            description: `In the School of Biotechnology, we bring together highly talented, innovative and well groomed faculty with specialization in diverse fields ranging from various basic to advanced aspects of Biotechnology. Our faculty includes skilled personnel with excellent research experience from renowned universities and institutes of India and abroad. These faculty members motivate students to work in collaborative environment. The faculty is imbued with a sense of deep commitment and is capable of imparting state of art education. They work hard to inculcate scientific ethics, morality and inquisitiveness.The school offers various programmes at different entry levels finally aimed to confer the degree of Master of Technology (M. Tech) in Biotechnology with specializations in the areas of Genetic engineering and Bioinformatics.                      We have started our programme with the objective of generating work force that could turn into a substantially trained manpower to meet the existing and future global demands. The school is equipped with state of art laboratories and a curriculum tailored to suit the needs of various sectors of economy. The programme curricula combine a strong theoretical background coupled with practical experience in laboratory with a view to achieve their optimum potential as researcher. The foundation thus laid enables students to enhance their learning capability and adapt themselves to the fast scientific development in the world. We strive to keep our students updated with ongoing progress in frontier areas of Biotechnology. Our vision is to make School of Biotechnology a truly academic and research and development center providing the balanced combination of teaching and research fused with power of innovation`,
