                In accordance with the Vision of the University, School of
                Engineering has been conceptualized and established with an
                objective to work out and develop a dependable model for growth,
                consistency and significant breakthrough in cutting edge
                technology and innovation. The rapid diffusion of core
                engineering fields like Civil Engineering, Electrical
                Engineering and Mechanical Engineering has the potential of
                bringing improvement in productivity and efficiency in almost
                every aspects of our life and consequently turning out to be a
                key driver of our economic growth. We are committed to prepare
                technology leaders for tomorrow with our innovative curriculum
                and meticulous pedagogy for training. The programmes offered are
                unique in their right and fall in line with international
                practices. Our efforts travel beyond classrooms and encompass
                trends and practices through our research and modular training
                at par with some of the best institutions of national and
                international repute. We encourage our graduates to opt for
                courses from different streams which shall not restrict them to
                one area but open new avenues in their field of interest.
                Faculty members are encouraged to use innovative tools in their
                teaching. We ensure that our graduate students possess necessary
                skills like Creativity, Innovation, Critical Thinking, Problem
                Solving and Collaboration.

      description: `It is my proud privilege to welcome you at School of Engineering on the Website of Gautam Buddha University. The School has came in to existence in the academic session, 2010 -11 with the beginning of Five years Integrated dual degree program ( B.Tech. + M.Tech / M.B.A.) in three core branches of engineering ( Civil, Mechanical & Electrical ). In the academic session, 2014 -15, the first batch of Engineers of the University is going to pass out. In successive years B. Arch in Architecture & Regional Planning, Masters & Doctoral Programs in different disciplines have come in to existence.
As an academic community, the school is committed to the belief that expanding our knowledge of the liberal Sciences & Technologies will enable us to live better lives and to contribute more to society. Thus we are constantly trying to remain competitive, to maintain excellence in teaching to strengthen our undergraduate and graduate programs and to build the School's research agenda to increase the external partnerships & sponsors. I hope that you will join us in our mission.`,
